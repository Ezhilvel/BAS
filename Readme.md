# [BAS: An R package for Bayesian Model Averaging using Adaptive Samping ](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS)

The  `BAS` [R](http://r-project.org) package is designed to
provide an easy to use package and fast code for implementing Bayesian Model
Averaging and Model Selection in R using state of the art prior
distributions for linear and generalized linear models.  All of the
prior distributions in `BAS` are based on Zellner's g-prior or
mixtures of g-priors.  These have been shown to be consistent and have
a number of computational advantages. BAS implements two main
algorithms for sampling from the space of potential models: an
adaptive sampling without replacement algorithm and a MCMC algorithm
that utilizes swapping to escape from local modes.  More details are
in the R man pages.

# Installation

The stable version [![](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/BAS)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BAS) can be installed easily in the `R` console like any other package:

```r
install.packages('BAS')
```

On the other hand, I welcome everyone to use the most recent version
of the package with quick-fixes, new features and probably new
bugs. It's currently hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/merliseclyde/VAS). To get the latest
development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/merliseclyde),
use the `devtools` package from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools) and enter in `R`:

```r
devtools::install_github('merliseclyde/BAS')
```

Installing the package from source does require compilation of C and FORTRAN code as the library makes use of BLAS and LAPACK for efficient model fitting.  See [CRAN manuals](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-admin.html) for installing packages from source under different operating systems.
